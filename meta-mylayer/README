- In this tutorial we are going learn about rconfilcts.
- It is a variable used to declare run-time conflicts between different packages.
- This allows you to specify two or more packages cannot be installed on the target
system at the same time due to conflicts that my arise during runtime.
- So it means that through rconflicts we can control that.
- If two packages are defined in the image, so it shows that error.
